# InfiniteRunnerGame
An infinite runner type game. It was created using the OpenGL framework provided by my university.

How to play:
  - The goal is to survive as long as you can by dodging the U.F.O.'s or shooting through them.
  - Shooting uses ammo so collect ammo crates to keep firing.
  - Avoid hitting the U.F.O.'s; They hurt :(
  - Hotkeys:
    - Arrow up/down: plane movement
    - Spacebar: fire bullets
    
Skills aquired/reinforced during this project:
  - 3D computer graphics fundamentals
  - Using OpenGL shaders
  - Object Oriented Programming
